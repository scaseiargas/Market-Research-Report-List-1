<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor CIS for Non mobile Applications Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Shutter</li><li>Global Shutter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) for non-mobile applications are classified into two main types: rolling shutter and global shutter. Rolling shutter captures images line-by-line, leading to potential distortion in fast-moving scenes, making it suitable for applications where motion is minimal. In contrast, global shutter captures the entire frame simultaneously, eliminating motion artifacts, making it ideal for high-speed and dynamic environments like industrial automation and automotive systems. Both types serve distinct needs based on image capture requirements and application dynamics.</p></p>
